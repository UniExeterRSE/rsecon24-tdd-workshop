# Example tables

The aim is to represent tabular data in a format suitable for printing to the
console.

Notice that columns are separated by two spaces.

```out
colA  colB
----------
1     10  
2     20  
3     30  
```

The width of the columns should be wide enough to contain the column headers:

```out
colAAAAA  colB
--------------
1         10  
2         20  
3         30  
```

The width of the columns should also be wide enough to contain the main table
entries:

```out
colA  colB       colC
---------------------
1     foo        10  
2     barrrrrrr  20  
3     baz        30  
```
